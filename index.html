      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>
        Hello, I'm Jasfer, an aspiring software engineer, currently a Year 1
        studying Information Technology at Nanyang Polytechnic.
      </p>
      <p>
        My interests include coding, gaming, and investing in cryptocurrencies!
        Some examples of such would be learning React on my own, scouring for an
        NFT that doesn't just look good, but also has utility behind it, and
        more.
      </p>
      <h1>My Family</h1>
      <p>
        I have a lovely family, which consists of me, my younger brother, my two
        older sisters and my parents. Often times people think it's fascinating
        to see a family that can be divided equally by gender. (3 males, 3
        females!)
